<!--this is a simple unordered list of the ingredients required to cook the recipe-->


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Place the 3 medium-size chicken breasts in a lightly oiled glass dish and pre-heat the oven to 425°. While you wait for the oven to
        heat, add a bit of Cavender's Greek Seasoning on top of the breasts.
    Once the oven is heated to 425°, put the glass dish with the chicken breasts in the oven and set a timer for 23-26 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>While the chicken is baking, fill a large pot with 3.5 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil 
        and add in the fettucini noodles. Cook the noodles for 11 minutes, then drain the water. Add a tablespoon of sunflower oil to the drained noodles
        and stir. The oil will keep the noodles from sticking together.
    </p>
    <p> In a large pan, add a tablespoon of sunflower oil and get it heated up. Add the spinach and mushrooms, cook
        on a medium heat until the mushrooms are a little soft. Add in alfredo sauce and cut chicken breasts, simmer for 2-3 minutes.
