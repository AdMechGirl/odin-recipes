    <p>This is a quite simplistic recipe for those of you who want something tasty
        but not too difficult after a hard day of work.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 jar of your favorite alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>3 medium size chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 box of fettucini noodles (16oz)</li>
        <li>8oz of fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms</li>
        <li>6oz of spinach</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of iodized salt</li>
        <li>3.5 quarts of water</li>
        <li>Cavender's Greek Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
<!--this is a simple list for the ingredients required to cook the recipe-->


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>Place the 3 medium-size chicken breasts in a lightly oiled glass dish and pre-heat the oven to 425°. While you wait for the oven to
        heat, add a bit of Cavender's Greek Seasoning on top of the breasts.
    Once the oven is heated to 425°, put the glass dish with the chicken breasts in the oven and set a timer for 23-26 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>While the chicken is baking, fill a large pot with 3.5 quarts of water and 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil 
        and add in the fettucini noodles. Cook the noodles for 11 minutes, then drain the water. Add a tablespoon of sunflower oil to the drained noodles
        and stir. The oil will keep the noodles from sticking together. Set the noodles in the pot aside and put a lid on the pot
        to keep them warm
    </p>
    <p>After the chicken is fully-cooked, remove it from the oven and cut the chicken breasts into cubes.
